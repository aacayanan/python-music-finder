# Music Finder ðŸŽµ

A Python-based app to practice dataset manipulation and Python programming, made for keeping my sanity during finals week! This project was both a fun experiment and a way to sharpen my skills using large datasets and GUI's.



## What It Does

The music finder application allows users to explore new music through artists who made a top 5000 greatest hits of all time list and their genres. 

- Step 1: Login to use the application, or create a new account.
- Step 2: Choose genres from a drop-down menu or add your own.
- Step 3: The app analyzes a dataset of a top 5000 greatest hits of all time dataset to find artists that match your selected genres.
- Step 4: It generates a personalized playlist featuring those artists to explore new music!

Whether you're a music enthusiast or someone looking to create custom playlists,  this app can serve as a useful tool for you.
